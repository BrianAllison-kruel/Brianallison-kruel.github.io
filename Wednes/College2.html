<p style="font-size: 30px; color: blueviolet">This college focuses mostly on aspiring game developers who are ethusiastic about programming and persuing video games as a career. However there are other career paths that this college offers, such as hardware programming and creation, Web design, Sound design and Concept Creation. Since this is a college that relates to the creation of video games, most programmers and designers are immediately rewarded with a job that relates to this field after graduation or even during school.</p>
